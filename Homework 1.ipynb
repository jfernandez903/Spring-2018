    "## Introduction:\n",
    "In this assignment I will empirically verify the concept of confidence intervals. A confidence interval is a range of values in which we are confident the true value of a parameter lies in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, I will be using a Normal distribution with mean $\\mu = 3$ and variance $\\sigma^2 = 25$, i.e. $N(3,25)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theoretical $(1-\\alpha)$% confidence interval for a $N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)$ distribution for the parameter $\\mu$ is $\\mu \\pm z_{\\alpha/2}\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$ where n is the number of observations in the sample. Furthermore the theoretical $(1-\\alpha)$% confidence interval for the parameter $\\sigma^2$ is $[\\frac{(n-1)\\sigma^2}{\\chi^2_{1-\\alpha/2}},\\frac{(n-1)\\sigma^2}{\\chi^2_{\\alpha/2}}]$ where $\\chi^2$ has n-1 degrees of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will generate 100 random samples of 1000 observations (n=1000) in order to see how many times the confidence bound is breached compared to 95%, 90%, and 80% confidence."
